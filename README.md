# Meteor Skeleton for @iDoMeteor

Meteor's create app is pretty handy, but once you settle in to a pattern,
it's nice to have your own skeleton that is a little less vanilla than
theirs.

Herein lies mine.

It includes the following:

Useful:
  * .csslint - For npm's csslint
  * .editorconfig - Set up some simple rules for compliant editors
  * .eslint - Based on node-style-guide & enhanced for Meteor compliance
  * .gitignore - Ignores vim swap files, .meteor/local, packages, private
  * .jscsrc - Super tuned for Meteor awesomeness, quickly fix your style
  * .meteor - A sane set of packages
  * .tern-project - For tern compliant editors, provides Meteor completions
  * /app - **Main application container w/client/lib/server, etc**
  * /drop-ins - A place to put in stand alone Meteor components (not packages)
  * /packages - A place to put your modularized local code
  * /private - A place to hide your privates
  * /public - A place to show your assetts
  * README.md - This file! Should be edited for every project.
  * settings-dev.json - A place for settings, should your project require them
  * settings-production.json - A place for settings, should your project require them

I will flesh out the app files sooner or later with some useful code templates.

Feel free to hit start up the issues or wiki, and I most certainly welcome
commentary via @iDoMeteor on Twitter or on http://forums.meteor.com.
